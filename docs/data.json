Because of `CORS` we can't load the data via `XMLHttpRequest` but will be using jsonp to get the data from gitlab.\n\n## The Technique\n\nTo use API data hosted on a domain other than your own, you need to use a technique called JSONP. From Wikipedia:\n\n    JSONP or ‚ÄúJSON with padding‚Äù is a communication technique used in JavaScript programs running in web browsers to request data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the same-origin policy. JSONP takes advantage of the fact that browsers do not enforce the same-origin policy on `<script>` tags.\n\nSource: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP)\n\nHere‚Äôs how it works: The API request URL is set as the src of a `<script>` tag, which gets appended to the DOM. That data is then passed into a callback method on load. The callback is included in the request url as `?callback=callbackMethodName`;\n","title":"Jsonp","shortdesc":"# JSONP\n\nWe are going to make a gitlab api call on my profile.

If they are a match, the cards stay overturned. Otherwise, both cards flip back over.\n- A score display that shows how many matches a user has made\n- If the user matches all the cards, display a congratulations message\n- A reset button which will restart the game and reset the cards\n- Style it. Make it look nice.\n\n## Bonus Features\n\n- Add a card-flipping animation when the user clicks a card\n- Add a time limit. If the time expires, show the user a game over screen.\n","title":"Memory","shortdesc":"# Memory Game\n\n// var emojies = \"ü¶Ñü¶äüê∑üêπüêªüêºüê∏üê≤\";\nvar backCard = 'üÉè';\n\nYou're going to create a Javascript memory game on a subject of your choice(web frame ...","url":"memory","path":"docs/memory","tags":[]},{"description":"Photo-watermark","title":"Photo-watermark","shortdesc":"Photo-watermark ...","img":"Screenshot.png","url":"photo-watermark","path":"docs/photo-watermark","tags":[]},{"description":"Quotes","title":"Quotes","shortdesc":"Quotes ...","img":"Screenshot.png","url":"quotes","path":"docs/quotes","tags":[]},{"description":"# Sketch\n\nUse canvas to make a sketch pad.
