# Memory Game

// var emojies = "🦄🦊🐷🐹🐻🐼🐸🐲";
var backCard = '🃏';

You're going to create a Javascript memory game on a subject of your choice(web frameworks, dog breeds, etc.) See the example gifs at the bottom of the page for inspiration.

## The requirements

- The game must consist of at least 16 cards
- A user can click two cards each turn. If they are a match, the cards stay overturned. Otherwise, both cards flip back over.
- A score display that shows how many matches a user has made
- If the user matches all the cards, display a congratulations message
- A reset button which will restart the game and reset the cards
- Style it. Make it look nice.

## Bonus Features

- Add a card-flipping animation when the user clicks a card
- Add a time limit. If the time expires, show the user a game over screen.
