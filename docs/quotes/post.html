    The Technique
</h2>

<p>

    To use API data hosted on a domain other than your own, you need to use a technique called JSONP. From Wikipedia:

<blockquote>
    JSONP or “JSON with padding” is a communication technique used in JavaScript programs running in web browsers to
    request
    data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the same-origin
    policy. JSONP takes advantage of the fact that browsers do not enforce the same-origin policy on
    <code>%3Cscript></code> tags.
</blockquote>


Here’s how it works: The API request URL is set as the src of a %3Cscript> tag, which gets appended to the DOM.That data
is then passed into a callback method on load.The callback is included in the request url as
?callback=callbackMethodName;
